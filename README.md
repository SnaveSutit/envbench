# üí° Why Use Envbench?

There are several reasons you might want to have multiple environments:

-   Keep work and personal projects separate to prevent NDA risks when opening Blockbench.
-   Maintain clean environments for developing and testing plugins.
-   Have multiple versions of Blockbench installed without conflicts.
-   Save different instances for different projects, ensuring your start menu only displays relevant models.
